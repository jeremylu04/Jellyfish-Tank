# Jellyfish-Tank
 My program is a rudimentary simulation of a fish tank, where jellyfish are freely swimming about.
 
 The program starts with 1 jellyfish in the tank.
 Left mouse click adds more jellyfish, and right mouse click removes jellyfish to the tank.
 The minimum amount of jellyfish in the tank is set to 1.
